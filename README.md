- 👋 Hi, I’m Terence
- 👀 I am focused on becoming a professional developer by learning web technologies derived from Javascript and the C++ coding language. I am a diarist by inclination
  so I am a writer first and foremost. 
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself React, JS and C++. I have taken a few classes and I just completed the NYU Bridge to Tandon program. I possess general knowledge in Computer Science, Python, Git, Bash, C++, JS and PHP. It's a wide net I have cast, and I consider myself a beginner. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, in fact, I am most interested in collaborating and making contacts.
