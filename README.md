- 👋 Hi, I’m Terence Minerbrook
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a web developer, and learning web technologies derived from Javascript. I am a diarist by inclination
  so I am a writer first and foremost. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and JS. I have taken a few classes and I just completed the Tandon Bridge program. So I have skills in 
  web development, Python, Git, Bash, C++ and JS. I am still a beginner though. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, in fact, I am most interested in collaborating and making contacts.
