- 👋 Hi, I’m Terence Minerbrook
- 👀 I am focused on web development, and learning web technologies derived from Javascript. I am a diarist by inclination
  so I am a writer first and foremost. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, JS(and it's flavors) and C++. I have taken a few classes and I just completed the NYU Bridge to Tandon program. I possess general knowledge in Computer Science, Python, Git, Bash, C++, JS and PHP. It's a wide net I have cast, and I consider myself a beginner. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, in fact, I am most interested in collaborating and making contacts.
